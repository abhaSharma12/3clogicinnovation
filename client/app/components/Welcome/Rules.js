                            <p>Amazon India is calling tech enthusiasts across India to join “Alexa Skills Hackathon”
                                and build voice-first experiences. This hackathon will require you to think outside
                                of the traditional development process and embrace a voice-first design approach,
                                        leading with the customer experience</p>
                            <p>Alexa, the voice service behind Amazon Echo and Echo Dot, is changing how we interact
                                with technology. Alexa can be a concierge, sous chef, fitness coach, personal shopper,
                                        and DJ — every time you add a new skill, you make Alexa even smarter.</p>
